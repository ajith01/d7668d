# Part 3

### What database changes would be required to the starter code to allow for different roles for authors of a blog post? Imagine that weâ€™d want to also be able to add custom roles and change the permission sets for certain roles on the fly without any code changes.

<br />
<br />

#### There are many ways to go about making this change. The least intrusive way would be to create another database model for `Roles`, which will have `roles_id (pk)`, `role_name`, and `permission` as fields. The `UserPost` model must be changed to include the `roles_id` as a foreign key. This way the role of the user for this particular post can be determined by querying the `UserPost` table with the `post_id` to determine the `role_id` which can be used to query the `Roles` table for the permissions. I would also consider making `role_id` and `user_id` composite keys of the `UserPost` table to make updating the tables more efficent.

<br />
<br />

### How would you have to change the PATCH route given your answer above to handle roles?

<br />
<br />

#### The changes I would make to the PATCH route above to use the database model given above is that I would query records from the `UserPost` table where `post_id` matches the id given in the API parameters and `user_id` matches the id of the logged-in user. If a record is returned, I will use the `role_id` from the record to query the `Roles` table to determine if the user is allowed to update the post. The role should be validated by checking if it is one of the allowed roles. If they do not have permission to update the posts I will send an error message stating they do not have permission to make changes and returns.

#### If `authorIDs` are provided in the request, Updating the `authorIds` would be changed to give the users a `role_id` as this field is not present in the `UserPost` table. There are two options to give the `role_id`; The user can be required to give a `role_id` along with the `authorIDs` (in a multidimensional array), or a defult `role_id` can be given.

#### The latter case is trivial, in the former case, there should be validation to determine if the `role_id` provided for each of the `authorIDs` is a valid role. Furthermore, the `role_id` must be validated to be a role with less permisions than the user making the patch request to prevent unintended access.
